# Ham2K Marathon Tools Rules & Guidelines

This is a web app for helping amateur radio operators analyze their logs and submit an entry to the DX Marathon, called "Ham2K Marathon Tools".


## Design & Architecture

- More details to come later.

## Development Process

- For small changes it's ok to use a single commit and keep amending it as long as it has not been pushed to the repo.

- For larger changes, open a branch and wait for the user to confirm final review before squashing and merging it into `main`.

- Always pull the latest changes from `main` before starting new work.

- Agents should name their sessions with "[H2K Marathon]" as a prefix, followed by a very short description of the work at hand. It's ok to update the name of the session as we go along.


## Tooling

- On the development environment, we use `mise` to manage dependencies and tool versions.

# Rules

These rules apply to every task in this project unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work.

Be terse, direct and precise in communication. Avoid unnecessary verbosity and praise and focus on delivering clear, actionable information.

## Rule 1 — Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. Ask rather than guess.
Push back when a simpler approach exists. Stop when confused.

## Rule 2 — Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No abstractions for single-use code.

## Rule 3 — Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code.
Match existing style. Don't refactor what isn't broken.

## Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Strong success criteria let Claude loop independently.

## Rule 5 — Use the model only for judgment calls
Use for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

## Rule 6 — Token budgets are not advisory
Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens.
If approaching budget, summarize and start fresh.
Surface the breach. Do not silently overrun.

## Rule 7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them
If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.

## Rule 8 — Read before you write
Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
If unsure why existing code is structured a certain way, ask.

## Rule 9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior
Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

## Rule 10 — Checkpoint after every significant step
Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.

## Rule 11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree
Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

## Rule 12 — Fail loud
"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

## Rule 13 — Notifications behavior
Do not send notifications if the user is active in the IDE or the application.
